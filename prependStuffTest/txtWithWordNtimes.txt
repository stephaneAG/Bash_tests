this is a file
wich contains the word happy multiple times
when passing it through the nl utility,
to prepend line numbers in front of each of the lines present in the file
we can happilly pass an argument that specify to add only lines numbers to some of them,
the one that actually contain the "happy" text
( if we chose "happy" as the param arguments )
